# Supplementary Material for "Autonomous LLM-driven research from data to human-verifiable research papers"


This repository contains the supplementary material of the pre-print [arXiv:2404.17605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17605) **"Autonomous LLM-driven research from data to human-verifiable research papers"**, in which we describe 
**data-to-paper**, a framework for systematically navigating the power of AI to perform complete end-to-end 
data-science research, starting from raw data and concluding with comprehensive, reproducible, and correct 
scientific papers. **data-to-paper software** can be found [here](https://github.com/Technion-Kishony-lab/data-to-paper).

In 4 case studies, we showed that data-to-paper can perform full run cycles, from data alone to complete research papers, across different datasets and fields:

* **Health Indicators (open goal).** A clean unweighted subset of CDCâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 annual dataset 
  ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset)).
    [Example Paper](https://github.com/rkishony/data-to-paper-supplementary/blob/main/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscripts/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscript%20A.pdf) created by data-to paper.


* **Social Network (open goal).** A directed graph of Twitter interactions among the 117th Congress members
  ([Fink et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10493874/)).
    [Example Paper](https://github.com/rkishony/data-to-paper-supplementary/blob/main/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscripts/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscript%20B.pdf) created by data-to paper.


* **Treatment Policy (fixed-goal).** A dataset on treatment and outcomes of non-vigorous infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), before and after a change to treatment guidelines was implemented
  ([Saint-Fleur et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289945)).
    [Example Paper](https://github.com/rkishony/data-to-paper-supplementary/blob/main/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscripts/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscript%20C.pdf) created by data-to paper.


* **Treatment Optimization (fixed-goal).** A dataset of pediatric patients, which received mechanical ventilation after undergoing surgery, including an x-ray-based determination of the optimal tracheal tube intubation depth and a set of personalized patient attributes to be used in machine learning and formula-based models to predict this optimal depth
  ([Shim et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257069)).
    [Example Paper](https://github.com/rkishony/data-to-paper-supplementary/blob/main/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscripts/Supplementary%20Data-chained%20Manuscript%20D.pdf) created by data-to paper.
